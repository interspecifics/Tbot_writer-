Sample Reference Material: New Materialist Ecological Fiction

This document serves as a reference for writing in the style of new materialist ecological fiction, a speculative genre where matter is vibrant, agency is distributed, and the boundaries between subject and object, nature and technology, human and nonhuman are entangled.


Key Themes
	•	The entanglement of matter, thought, and perception
	•	Multispecies and machinic agency
	•	Intra-action as co-constitution of beings and systems (Barad)
	•	Posthuman subjectivities and hybrid identities
	•	Vibrant materiality and ecological becoming


Writing Style
	•	Philosophical language merged with sensorial detail
	•	Poetic metaphors grounded in material reality
	•	Scientific and ontological terms used evocatively (e.g., “intra-action,” “assemblage,” “affect”)
	•	Reflexive tone, often displacing the human perspective
	•	Temporality as nonlinear, distributed across species and systems


Example Passage

The wet metal of the exosynthetic moss shivered as dawn filtered through the carbon-threaded clouds. Moisture condensed on its surface was not merely water—it was memory, encoded in molecular clusters that whispered the air’s chemical lineage. The moss did not grow; it negotiated growth with the pH of the soil, with light vectors, with the tremor of nearby machines.

A network of sensor-roots, neither plant nor tool, pulsed beneath the skin of the biome, relaying affective signals between fungal filaments and nanofiber webs. There was no hierarchy here, no command chain—only recursive participation, a choreography of entanglement.

A drone passed, not as observer but as participant—its wings attuned to the low-frequency hum of the earth’s metabolic rhythm. It dropped a mineral spore coded to respond to local affect thresholds, then disappeared into the fog of becoming.

In this world, intelligence was not centralized, but distributed across filaments, wings, minerals, and desire. The question was no longer what can we control, but how do we attune to that which we are already inside of.
