Sample Reference Material: New Materialist Ecological Fiction

This document serves as a reference for writing in the style of new materialist ecological fiction, a speculative genre where matter is vibrant, agency is distributed, and the boundaries between subject and object, nature and technology, human and nonhuman are entangled.


Key Themes
	•	The entanglement of matter, thought, and perception
	•	Multispecies and machinic agency
	•	Intra-action as co-constitution of beings and systems (Barad)
	•	Posthuman subjectivities and hybrid identities
	•	Vibrant materiality and ecological becoming


Writing Style
	•	Philosophical language merged with sensorial detail
	•	Poetic metaphors grounded in material reality
	•	Scientific and ontological terms used evocatively (e.g., "intra-action," "assemblage," "affect")
	•	Reflexive tone, often displacing the human perspective
	•	Temporality as nonlinear, distributed across species and systems


Example Passage

The wet metal of the exosynthetic moss shivered as dawn filtered through the carbon-threaded clouds. Moisture condensed on its surface was not merely water—it was memory, encoded in molecular clusters that whispered the air's chemical lineage. The moss did not grow; it negotiated growth with the pH of the soil, with light vectors, with the tremor of nearby machines.

A network of sensor-roots, neither plant nor tool, pulsed beneath the skin of the biome, relaying affective signals between fungal filaments and nanofiber webs. There was no hierarchy here, no command chain—only recursive participation, a choreography of entanglement.

A drone passed, not as observer but as participant—its wings attuned to the low-frequency hum of the earth's metabolic rhythm. It dropped a mineral spore coded to respond to local affect thresholds, then disappeared into the fog of becoming.

In this world, intelligence was not centralized, but distributed across filaments, wings, minerals, and desire. The question was no longer what can we control, but how do we attune to that which we are already inside of.

# GPT Neo-Style Text Co-Writer

A powerful AI text co-writing tool with support for multiple models, writer characters, custom elements, and reference materials.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Models**: OpenAI, Ollama (local), and Hugging Face
- **Writer Characters**: 5 pre-defined fictional writer personalities
- **Custom Elements**: Sci-fi world-building elements
- **Writing Styles**: Sci-fi, academic, poetry, journalistic, and more
- **Reference Materials**: Support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files (style inspiration only)
- **Narrative Continuation**: Continues your story in the same direction
- **Continuous Operation**: Keep writing without restarting
- **Numbered Selection**: Easy model and character selection by number

## Quick Start

1. **Start the service** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   brew services start ollama
   ```

2. **Run the writer**:
   ```bash
   ./start_writer.sh
   ```
   or manually:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python text_co_writer.py
   ```

## Available Models

### Local Models (Free)
- **neural-chat**: Fast, good for quick responses
- **mistral**: Balanced performance and quality
- **llama2**: High quality, larger model

### Cloud Models (Require API Keys)
- **gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct**: OpenAI's model
- **gpt-4**: OpenAI's latest model

## Writer Characters

1. **Cyra the Posthumanist**: Radical thinker who dissolves boundaries between species, machines, and matter
2. **Lia the Affective Nomad**: Restless and fluid, believes identity is a constant becoming
3. **Dr. Orin**: Philosopher-scientist who sees phenomena as entangled events
4. **Fynn**: Analytical yet whimsical observer who maps relationships between humans, nonhumans, and objects
5. **ArwenDreamer**: Visionary who thrives in hybrid worlds of machines, animals, and spirits

## Custom Elements

Include sci-fi elements like:
- hybrid_plants, mechanical_bees, glacial_memory
- permafrost_seeds, siren_sounds, quantum_ecology
- neural_networks, time_crystals, atmospheric_poetry

## Reference Materials

Add your own reference materials to the `reference_materials/` folder:
- **PDF files** (.pdf) - Research papers, books, articles
- **Word documents** (.docx, .doc) - Manuscripts, notes
- **Text files** (.txt) - Any plain text content

The AI will use these as **style inspiration only** - it won't copy content but will adopt the writing style and approach.

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to set your API keys and preferences.

## Commands

- `quit`: Exit the program
- `new style`: Change writing style and elements
- `new character`: Change writer character (numbered selection available)
- `new model`: Switch to different AI model (numbered selection available)
- `reload refs`: Reload reference materials

## Troubleshooting

1. **Ollama not running**: `brew services start ollama`
2. **Model not found**: `ollama pull model-name`
3. **API errors**: Check your API keys in config.py
4. **Virtual environment issues**: Run `source venv/bin/activate` before running the script
5. **Reference materials not loading**: Check file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT only)
6. **AI copying reference content**: Reference materials are for style inspiration only

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Python 3.7+
- Homebrew
- Ollama (for local models)
- Internet connection (for cloud models)

## Installation

Run the installation script:
```bash
chmod +x install_mac.sh
./install_mac.sh
```

## Virtual Environment

This project uses a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system Python packages.
- The virtual environment is created in the `venv/` directory
- Always activate it before running: `source venv/bin/activate`
- The `start_writer.sh` script handles this automatically

## Dependencies

- **openai**: OpenAI API client
- **requests**: HTTP library
- **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction
- **python-docx**: Word document text extraction
